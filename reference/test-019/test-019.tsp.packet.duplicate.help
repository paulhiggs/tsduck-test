Duplicate PID's, reusing null packets

Usage: tsp -P duplicate [options] [pid[-pid]=newpid ...]

Parameters:

  Each duplication is specified as "pid=newpid" or "pid1-pid2=newpid" (all
  PID's can be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values). In the first form,
  the PID "pid" is duplicated to "newpid". In the latter form, all PID's within
  the range "pid1" to "pid2" (inclusive) are respectively duplicated to
  "newpid", "newpid"+1, etc. This behaviour can be changed using option
  --single. The null PID 0x1FFF cannot be duplicated.

Options:

  -d
  --drop-overflow
      Silently drop overflow packets. By default, overflow packets trigger
      warnings. See also option --max-buffered-packets.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -m value
  --max-buffered-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of buffered packets. The input packets to
      duplicate are internally buffered until a null packet is found and
      replaced by the buffered packet. An overflow is usually caused by
      insufficient null packets in the input stream. The default is 1,024
      packets.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the duplicated packets. Several
      --reset-label options may be specified.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the duplicated packets. Several --set-label
      options may be specified.

  -s
  --single
      When a duplication is in the form "pid1-pid2=newpid", duplicate all input
      PID's to the same "newpid" value, not "newpid", "newpid"+1, etc. This
      option forces --unchecked since distinct PID's are duplicated to the same
      one.

  -u
  --unchecked
      Do not perform any consistency checking while duplicating PID's;
      duplicating two PID's to the same PID or to a PID which is already
      present in the input is accepted. Note that this option should be used
      with care since the resulting stream can be illegal or inconsistent.
