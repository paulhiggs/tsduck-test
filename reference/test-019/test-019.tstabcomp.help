PSI/SI tables compiler

Usage: tstabcomp [options] filename ...

Parameters:

  XML or JSON source files to compile or binary table files to decompile. By
  default, files ending in .xml or .json are compiled and files ending in .bin
  are decompiled. For other files, explicitly specify --compile or --decompile.

  If an input file name is "-", the standard input is used. In that case,
  --compile or --decompile must be specified.

  If an input file name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML
  content". Similarly, if an input file name starts with "{" or "[", it is
  considered as "inline JSON content".

  The reference source format is XML. JSON files are first translated to XML
  using the "automated XML-to-JSON conversion" rules of TSDuck and then
  compiled.

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --compile
      Compile all files as XML or JSON source files into binary files. This is
      the default for .xml and .json files.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --decompile
      Decompile all files as binary files into XML files. This is the default
      for .bin files.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --eit-actual
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual. Same as --eit-actual-pf
      --eit-actual-schedule.

  --eit-actual-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual p/f. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-actual-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual schedule. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-base-date date
      With --eit-normalization, use the specified date as reference for the
      allocation of the various EIT events in sections and segments. The date
      must be in the format "year/month/day [hh:mm:ss]". If only the date is
      present, it is used as base for the allocation of EIT schedule. If the
      time is also specified, it is the current time for the snapshot of EIT
      present/following. By default, use the oldest date in all EIT sections as
      base date.

  --eit-normalization
      Reorganize all EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. One
      single EIT p/f subtable is built per service. It is split in two
      sections, one for present and one for following events. All EIT schedule
      are kept but they are completely reorganized. All events are extracted
      and spread over new EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. If
      several files are specified, the reorganization of EIT's is performed
      inside each file independently. This is fine as long as all EIT's for a
      given service are in the same input file. See also option
      --eit-base-date.

  --eit-other
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other. Same as --eit-other-pf
      --eit-other-schedule.

  --eit-other-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other p/f. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-other-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other schedule. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT p/f. Same as --eit-actual-pf
      --eit-other-pf.

  --eit-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT schedule. Same as
      --eit-actual-schedule --eit-other-schedule.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -e
  --extensions
      With --xml-model, include the content of the available extensions.

  -f
  --from-json
      Each input file must be a JSON file, typically from a previous automated
      XML-to-JSON conversion or in a similar format. This is automatically
      detected for file names ending in .json. This option is only required
      when the input file name has a non-standard extension or is the standard
      input.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  -j
  --json
      When decompiling, perform an automated XML-to-JSON conversion. The output
      file is in JSON format instead of XML. The default output file names have
      extension .json.

  -o file-name
  --output file-name
      Specify the output file name. By default, the output file has the same
      name as the input and extension .bin (compile), .xml or .json
      (decompile). If the specified path is a directory, the output file is
      built from this directory and default file name. If the specified name is
      "-", the standard output is used.

      The default output file for the standard input ("-") is the standard
      output ("-"). If more than one input file is specified, the output path,
      if present, must be either a directory name or "-".

  --pack-and-flush
      When loading a binary section file, pack incomplete tables and flush
      them. Sections are renumbered to remove any hole between sections. Use
      with care because this may create inconsistent tables.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  --strict-xml
      Save XML documents in strictly conformant XML format. By default, do not
      escape characters when this is not syntactically necessary to make the
      XML text more human-readable.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  --x2j-collapse-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces and
      replace all other sequences of space characters by one single space in
      all text nodes. By default, text nodes are collapsed only when there is
      an XML model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal
      content.

  --x2j-enforce-boolean
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains a
      boolean value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really a
      boolean, force the creation of a JSON boolean. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-enforce-integer
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains an
      integer value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really an
      integer, force the creation of a JSON number. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-include-root
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, keep the root of the XML document as a
      JSON object. By default, the JSON document is made of an array of all XML
      elements under the root.

  --x2j-trim-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces in all
      text nodes. By default, text nodes are trimmed only when there is an XML
      model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal content.

  -x
  --xml-model
      Display the XML model of the table files. This model is not a full
      XML-Schema, this is an informal template file which describes the
      expected syntax of TSDuck XML files. If --output is specified, save the
      model here. Do not specify input files.
