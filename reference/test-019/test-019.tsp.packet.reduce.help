Reduce the TS bitrate by removing stuffing packets

Usage: tsp -P reduce [options]

Parameters:

  Legacy syntax: For compatibility, two integer parameters can be used to
  specify 'rempkt' and 'inpkt', the removal of packets in fixed proportion. Now
  preferably use option --fixed-proportion.

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -f rempkt/inpkt
  --fixed-proportion rempkt/inpkt
      Reduce the bitrate in fixed proportion: 'rempkt' TS packets are
      automatically removed after every 'inpkt' input TS packets in the
      transport stream. Only stuffing packets can be removed. Both 'rempkt' and
      'inpkt' must be non-zero integer values. Exactly one of --target-bitrate
      or --fixed-proportion must be specified.

  -i value
  --input-bitrate value
      Specify the input bitrate in bits/second. By default, the input bitrate
      is permanently evaluated by previous plugins.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --packet-window packet-count
      With --target-bitrate, define the number of packets over which they are
      analyzed and extra packets are removed. The default is 10,000 packets.
      Options --time-window and --packet-window are mutually exclusive.

  -p
  --pcr-based
      With --target-bitrate, use PCR's in each packet window to determine how
      many packets should be removed in each window. By default, the input
      bitrate is used. In the case of highly variable bitrate (VBR), using
      PCR's on each time window gives better results but PCR's must be present
      and accurate and the window size must be large enough to contain more
      than one PCR on at least one PID.

  -r pid1[-pid2]
  --reference-pcr-pid pid1[-pid2]
      With --pcr-based, use PCR's from the specified reference PID's only. The
      option --reference-pcr-pid can be present multiple time. By default,
      PCR's are used from any PID.

  -t value
  --target-bitrate value
      Reduce the bitrate to this target value in bits/second. Only stuffing
      packets can be removed. Exactly one of --target-bitrate or
      --fixed-proportion must be specified.

      Using the target bitrate method introduces an uncompressable latency in
      the stream, see options --time-window and --packet-window.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --time-window milliseconds
      With --target-bitrate, define the latency period over which packets are
      analyzed and extra packets are removed. To use this method, the bitrate
      must be known during the starting phase so that it can be turned into a
      number of packets. Options --time-window and --packet-window are mutually
      exclusive.
