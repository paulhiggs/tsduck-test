Analyze pcap and pcap-ng files

Usage: tspcap [options] [input-file]

Parameter:

  Input file in pcap or pcap-ng format, typically as saved by Wireshark. Use
  the standard input if no file name is specified.

Options:

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d [ip-address]:[port]
  --destination [ip-address]:[port]
      Filter IP packets based on the specified destination socket address. The
      optional port number is used for TCP and UDP packets only.

  --dvb-simulcrypt
      Dump the content of a session as DVB SimulCrypt protocol.
      Without --udp, the first TCP session matching the --source and
      --destination options is selected. The content of the session is
      interpreted as one of the TLV-based DVB SimulCrypt protocols and all
      messages are formatted.
      With --udp, all packets matching the --source and --destination options
      are interpreted as EMMG/PDG <=> MUX protocol (this is the only DVB
      SimulCrypt protocol which is based on UDP).

  -e
  --extract-tcp-stream
      Extract the content of a TCP session as hexadecimal dump. The two
      directions of the TCP session are dumped. The first TCP session matching
      the --source and --destination options is selected.

  --first-date date-time
      Filter packets starting at the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:
      mm:ss.mmm.

  --first-packet value
      Filter packets starting at the specified number. The packet numbering
      counts all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at
      1. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --first-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets starting at the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from
      the beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark
      in the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i microseconds
  --interval microseconds
      Print a summary of exchanged data by intervals of times in micro-seconds.

  --last-date date-time
      Filter packets up to the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss.
      mmm.

  --last-packet value
      Filter packets up to the specified number. The packet numbering counts
      all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at 1. This
      is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --last-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets up to the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from the
      beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in
      the "Time" column (in seconds).

  -l
  --list-streams
      List all data streams. A data streams is made of all packets from one
      source to one destination using one protocol.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --others
      Filter packets from "other" protocols, i.e. neither TCP nor UDP.

  -o file-name
  --output-tcp-stream file-name
      Extract the content of a TCP session and save it in the specified binary
      file. The first TCP session matching the --source and --destination
      options is selected. Unlike --extract-tcp-stream, only one side of the
      TCP session is saved, from --source to --destination. If the file name is
      "-", the standard output is used.

  -s [ip-address]:[port]
  --source [ip-address]:[port]
      Filter IP packets based on the specified source socket address. The
      optional port number is used for TCP and UDP packets only.

  -t
  --tcp
      Filter TCP packets.

  -u
  --udp
      Filter UDP packets.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "tls", "vatek", "zlib".

  --vlan-id value
      Filter packets from the specified VLAN id. This option can be specified
      multiple times. In that case, the values define nested VLAN ids, from the
      outer to inner VLAN.
