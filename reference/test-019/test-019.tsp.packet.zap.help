Zap on one or more services, remove all other services

Usage: tsp -P zap [options] service ...

Parameters:

  Specifies the services to keep. If an argument is an integer value (either
  decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is
  interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. Names are not case
  sensitive and blanks are ignored.

Options:

  -a value
  --audio value
      Specify a 3-letter audio language code to keep. Several --audio options
      can be specified. All other audio components are removed (unless
      specified in --audio-pid). By default, keep all audio components.

  --audio-pid value
      Specify an audio PID to keep. Several --audio-pid options can be
      specified. All other audio components are removed (unless specified in
      --audio). By default, keep all audio components.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --cas
      Keep Conditional Access System sections (CAT and EMM's). Remove them by
      default. Note that the ECM's for the specified services are always kept.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-16, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-16,
      UTF-8.

  --eit
      Keep EIT sections for the specified services. EIT sections for other
      services are removed. By default, all EIT's are removed.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-absent
      Do not stop if a specified service does not exist or disappears. Continue
      to pass an empty stream until the service appears or re-appears. By
      default, stop when a service is missing.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -e
  --no-ecm
      Remove all ECM PID's. By default, keep all ECM PID's.

  -n
  --no-subtitles
      Remove all subtitles. By default, keep all subtitles.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p
  --pes-only
      Keep only the PES elementary streams (audio, video, subtitles). Remove
      all PSI/SI and CAS information.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve the global TS bitrate.

  -t value
  --subtitles value
      Specify a 3-letter subtitles language code to keep. Several --subtitles
      options can be specified. All other subtitles components are removed
      (unless specified in --subtitles-pid). By default, keep all subtitles
      components.

  --subtitles-pid value
      Specify a subtitles PID to keep. Several --subtitles-pid options can be
      specified. All other subtitles components are removed (unless specified
      in --subtitles). By default, keep all subtitles components.
