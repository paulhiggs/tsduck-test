Shift one or more PID's forward in the transport stream

Usage: tsp -P pidshift [options]

Options:

  -b
  --backward
      Revert the list of PID's, meaning shift forward all PID's except those in
      -p or --pid options. In practice, this can be seen as shifting backward
      the selected PID's from the rest of the transport stream.

  --directory directory-name
      Specify a directory where the temporary buffer file is created (if one is
      needed). By default, the system-specific area for temporary files is
      used. The temporary file is hidden and automatically deleted on
      termination. Specifying another location can be useful to redirect very
      large buffers to another disk. If the reserved memory area is large
      enough to hold the buffer, no file is created.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-errors
      Ignore shift buffer size evaluation errors or shift buffer write errors,
      pass packets without shifting.

  -i milliseconds
  --initial-evaluation milliseconds
      With --time, specify the duration of the initial evaluation phase in
      milliseconds. This is a transport stream playout duration, not a
      wall-clock duration. The default is 1,000 milliseconds.

  -m value
  --memory-packets value
      Specify the number of packets which are cached in memory. Having a larger
      memory cache improves the performances. By default, the size of the
      memory cache is 128 packets.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --packets count
      Specify the size of the shift buffer in packets. There is no default, the
      size of the buffer shall be specified either using --packets or --time.
      Using --packets is less intuitive than --time but allows starting the
      shift from the beginning.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specify a PID or range of PID's to shift forward. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified. At least one of them is required.

  -t milliseconds
  --time milliseconds
      Specify the size of the shift buffer in milliseconds. During an initial
      evaluation phase (see option --initial-evaluation), the global bitrate of
      all PID's to shift forward is evaluated. This global bitrate is then used
      to convert the specified --time duration in a number of packets and this
      value is used as fixed-size for the shift buffer. Actual shifting the
      PID's starts at the end of this evaluation phase. There is no default,
      the size of the buffer shall be specified either using --packets or
      --time.
