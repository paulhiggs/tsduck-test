Act as an HTTP server and send TS packets to the incoming client

Usage: tsp -O http [options]

The implemented HTTP server is rudimentary. No SSL/TLS is supported, only the
http: protocol is accepted.

Only one client is accepted at a time. By default, tsp terminates if the client
disconnects (see option --multiple-clients).

The request "GET /" returns the transport stream content. All other requests
are considered as invalid (see option --ignore-bad-request). There is no
Content-Length response header since the size of the returned TS is unknown.
The server disconnects at the end of the data. There is no Keep-Alive.

Options:

  --buffer-size value
      Specifies the TCP socket send buffer size to the client connection
      (socket option).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-bad-request
      Ignore invalid HTTP requests and unconditionally send the transport
      stream.

  -m
  --multiple-clients
      Specifies that the server handle multiple clients, one after the other.
      By default, the plugin terminates the tsp session when the first client
      disconnects.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  -s [ip-address:]port
  --server [ip-address:]port
      Specifies the local TCP port on which the plugin listens for incoming
      HTTP connections. This option is mandatory. This plugin accepts only one
      HTTP connection at a time. When present, the optional address shall
      specify a local IP address or host name. By default, the server listens
      on all local interfaces.
