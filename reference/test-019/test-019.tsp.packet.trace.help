Trace packets with a custom message

Usage: tsp -P trace [options]

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -f 'string'
  --format 'string'
      Specify the format of trace lines. The fields with a % sign are replaced
      by the corresponding value:
      - %p : PID value.
      - %i : index of the packet as seen by the plugin.
      - %a : index in the input stream, including removed packets.
      When the letter after % is lowercase, the value is displayed in decimal.
      When it is uppercase, the value is displayed in hexadecimal. Use %% for a
      literal '%' sign. The default format is 'Packet: %i, PID: %P (%p)'.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Trace packets with any of these label values. Labels should have
      typically been set by a previous plugin in the chain. Several --label
      options may be specified.

      Note that the option --label is different from the generic option
      --only-label. The generic option --only-label acts at tsp level and
      controls which packets are passed to the plugin. All other packets are
      directly passed to the next plugin without going through this plugin. The
      option --label, on the other hand, is specific to the trace plugin and
      selects packets with specific labels among the packets which are passed
      to this plugin.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output file for reporting trace lines. By default, report
      trace lines on standard error using the tsp logging mechanism.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Trace packets with these PID values. By default, when no option --label
      or --pid is specified, all packets are traced. Several --pid options may
      be specified.
