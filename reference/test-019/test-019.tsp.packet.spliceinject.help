Inject SCTE 35 splice commands in a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P spliceinject [options]

The splice commands are injected as splice information sections, as defined by
the SCTE 35 standard. All forms of splice information sections can be injected.
The sections shall be provided by some external equipment, in real time. The
format of the section can be binary, XML or JSON. There are two possible
mechanisms to provide the sections: files or UDP.

Files shall be specified as one single specification with optional wildcards.
Example: --files '/path/to/dir/*'. All files which are copied or updated into
this directory are automatically loaded and injected. It is possible to
automatically delete all files after being loaded.

UDP datagrams shall contain exactly one XML or JSON document or binary
sections. The sections are injected upon reception.

Options:

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --buffer-size value
      Specifies the UDP socket receive buffer size in bytes (socket option).

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-16, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-16,
      UTF-8.

  -d
  --delete-files
      Specifies that the input files should be deleted after being loaded. By
      default, the files are left unmodified after being loaded. When a loaded
      file is modified later, it is reloaded and re-injected.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -f 'file-wildcard'
  --files 'file-wildcard'
      A file specification with optional wildcards indicating which files
      should be polled. When such a file is created or updated, it is loaded
      and its content is interpreted as binary, XML or JSON tables. All tables
      shall be splice information tables.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --inject-count value
      For non-immediate splice_insert() and time_signal() commands, specifies
      the number of times the same splice information section is injected. The
      default is 2. Other splice commands are injected once only.

  --inject-interval milliseconds
      For non-immediate splice_insert() and time_signal() commands, specifies
      the interval in milliseconds between two insertions of the same splice
      information section. The default is 800 milliseconds.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --max-file-size value
      Files larger than the specified size are ignored. This avoids loading
      large spurious files which could clutter memory. The default is 2,048
      bytes.

  --min-bitrate value
      The minimum bitrate to maintain in the PID carrying the splice
      information tables. By default, the PID remains inactive when there is no
      splice information. If this is a problem for monitoring tools, an
      artificial bitrate can be maintained using null splice commands.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --min-inter-packet value
      This option can be used instead of --min-bitrate when the bitrate of the
      transport stream is unknown or unreliable. The specified value is the
      number of TS packets between two splice commands.

  --min-stable-delay milliseconds
      A file size needs to be stable during that duration for the file to be
      reported as added or modified. This prevents too frequent poll
      notifications when a file is being written and his size modified at each
      poll. The default is 500 ms.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --pcr-pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying PCR reference clock. By default, use the PCR
      PID as declared in the PMT of the service.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specifies the PID for the injection of the splice information tables. By
      default, the injection of splice commands is done in the component of the
      service with a stream type equal to 0x86 in the PMT, as specified by SCTE
      35 standard.

  --poll-interval milliseconds
      Specifies the interval between two poll operations. The default is 500
      ms.

  --pts-pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying PTS reference clock. By default, use the video
      PID as declared in the PMT of the service.

  --queue-size value
      Specifies the maximum number of sections in the internal queue, sections
      which are received from files or UDP but not yet inserted into the TS.
      The default is 100.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  -s value
  --service value
      Specifies the service for the insertion of the splice information tables.
      If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it
      is interpreted as a service id. If it is an empty string or "-", the
      first service in the PAT is selected. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a
      service name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and
      blanks are ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT, use service
      ids only. If no service is specified, the options --pid and --pts-pid
      must be specified (--pcr-pid is optional).

  --start-delay milliseconds
      For non-immediate splice_insert() commands, start to insert the first
      section this number of milliseconds before the specified splice PTS
      value. The default is 2,000 milliseconds.

  -u [ip-address:]port
  --udp [ip-address:]port
      Specifies the local UDP port on which the plugin listens for incoming
      binary or XML splice information tables. When present, the optional
      address shall specify a local IP address or host name (by default, the
      plugin accepts connections on any local IP interface).

  -w
  --wait-first-batch
      When this option is specified, the start of the plugin is suspended until
      the first batch of splice commands is loaded and queued. Without this
      option, the input files or messages are loaded and queued asynchronously.
