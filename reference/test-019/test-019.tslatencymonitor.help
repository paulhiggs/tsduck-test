Monitor latency between two TS input sources

Usage: tslatencymonitor [options] \
    [-I input-name [input-options]] ...

Options:

  -b seconds
  --buffer-time seconds
      Specify the buffer time of timing data list in seconds. By default, the
      buffer time is 1 seconds.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l[value]
  --list-plugins[=value]
      List all available plugins.
      The 'value' must be one of "all", "input", "names-input", "names-output",
      "names-packet", "output", "packet".

  --log-message-count value
      Specify the maximum number of buffered log messages. Log messages are
      displayed asynchronously in a low priority thread. This value specifies
      the maximum number of buffered log messages in memory, before being
      displayed. When too many messages are logged in a short period of time,
      while plugins use all CPU power, extra messages are dropped. Increase
      this value if you think that too many messages are dropped. The default
      is 512 messages.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Output file name for CSV reporting (standard error by default).

  --output-interval seconds
      Specify the time interval between each output in seconds. The default is
      1 second.

  -s
  --synchronous-log
      Each logged message is guaranteed to be displayed, synchronously, without
      any loss of message. The downside is that a plugin thread may be blocked
      for a short while when too many messages are logged. This option shall be
      used when all log messages are needed and the source and destination are
      not live streams (files for instance). This option is not recommended for
      live streams, when the responsiveness of the application is more
      important than the logged messages.

  -t
  --timed-log
      Each logged message contains a time stamp.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "tls", "vatek", "zlib".
