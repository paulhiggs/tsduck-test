Skip leading TS packets of a stream

Usage: tsp -P skip [options] count

Parameter:

  Legacy parameter, now use --packets.

Options:

  -b value
  --bytes value
      Number of leading bytes to skip (rounded up to the next TS packet).

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  -m milliseconds
  --milli-seconds milliseconds
      Skip the specified number of leading milli-seconds. By default, this is
      wall-clock time (real time). See also option --pcr-based.

  -n value
  --null-sequence-count value
      Skip packets until the specified number of sequences of consecutive null
      packets is encountered.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --packets value
      Number of leading packets to skip.

  --pcr-based
      With --seconds or --milli-seconds, use playout time based on PCR values.
      By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real time).

  --seconds seconds
      Skip the specified number of leading seconds. By default, this is
      wall-clock time (real time). See also option --pcr-based.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded leading packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of
      removing them.

  --timestamp-based
      With --seconds or --milli-seconds, use playout time based on timestamp
      values from the input plugin. When input timestamps are not available or
      not monotonic, fallback to --pcr-based. By default, the time is based on
      the wall-clock time (real time).

  -u value
  --unit-start-count value
      Skip packets until the specified number of packets containing a payload
      unit start indicator is encountered.
