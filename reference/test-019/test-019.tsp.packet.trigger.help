Trigger actions on selected TS packets

Usage: tsp -P trigger [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all-labels
      All labels from options --label shall be set on a packet to be selected
      (logical 'and'). By default, a packet is selected if any label is set
      (logical 'or').

  -c file-name
  --copy file-name
      Copy the specified file when the current packet triggers the actions.
      See also option --destination.

  -d file-name
  --destination file-name
      With --copy, the file is copied to that specified destination. If the
      specified path is an existing directory, the file is copied in that
      directory, with the same name as input.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -e 'command'
  --execute 'command'
      Run the specified command when the current packet triggers the actions.
      See also option --synchronous.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Trigger the actions on packets with any of the specified labels. Labels
      should have typically be set by a previous plugin in the chain. By
      default, without option --label, the actions are triggered on all packets
      in the stream. Several --label options may be specified.

      Note that the option --label is different from the generic option
      --only-label. The generic option --only-label acts at tsp level and
      controls which packets are passed to the plugin. All other packets are
      directly passed to the next plugin without going through this plugin. The
      option --label, on the other hand, is specific to the trigger plugin and
      selects packets with specific labels among the packets which are passed
      to this plugin.

  --local-address ip-address
      With --udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the IP
      address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name that
      translates to a local address.

  --min-inter-packet count
      Specify the minimum number of packets between two triggered actions.
      Actions which should be triggered in the meantime are ignored.

  --min-inter-time milliseconds
      Specify the minimum time, in milliseconds, between two triggered actions.
      Actions which should be triggered in the meantime are ignored.

  --once
      Trigger the actions only once per label. When a packet with one or more
      labels from option --label has triggered the actions, these labels are
      disabled.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --start
      Trigger the actions on tsp start.

  --stop
      Trigger the actions on tsp stop.

  -s
  --synchronous
      With --execute, wait for the command to complete before processing the
      next packet. By default, the command runs asynchronously.

  --ttl value
      With --udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The actual
      option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on the
      destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on most
      systems.

  -u ip-address:port
  --udp ip-address:port
      Send a UDP/IP message to the specified destination when the current
      packet triggers the actions. The 'address' specifies an IP address which
      can be either unicast or multicast. It can be also a host name that
      translates to an IP address. The 'port' specifies the destination UDP
      port.

  --udp-message hexa-data
      With --udp, specifies the binary message to send as UDP datagram. The
      value must be a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of
      bytes.
