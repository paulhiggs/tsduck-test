Fix continuity counters in a transport stream

Usage: tsfixcc [options] filename

Parameter:

  MPEG capture file to be modified.

Options:

  -c
  --circular
      Enforce continuity when the file is played repeatedly. Add empty packets,
      if necessary, on each PID so that the continuity is preserved between end
      and beginning of file.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --no-action
      Display what should be performed but do not modify the file.

  --no-replicate-duplicated
      Two successive packets in the same PID are considered as duplicated if
      they have the same continuity counter and same content (except PCR, if
      any). By default, duplicated input packets are replicated as duplicated
      on output (the corresponding output packets have the same continuity
      counters). When this option is specified, the input packets are not
      considered as duplicated and the output packets receive individually
      incremented countinuity counters.

  --noaction
      Legacy equivalent of --no-action.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".
