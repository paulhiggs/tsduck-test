Pass or drop packets based on packet numbers

Usage: tsp -P slice [options]

Options:

  -d value
  --drop value
      All packets are dropped after the specified packet number. Several --drop
      options may be specified.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  -i
  --ignore-pcr
      When --seconds or --milli-seconds is used, do not use PCR's to compute
      time values. Only rely on bitrate as determined by previous plugins in
      the chain.

  -m
  --milli-seconds
      With options --drop, --null, --pass and --stop, interpret the integer
      values as milli-seconds from the beginning, not as packet numbers. Time
      is measured based on bitrate and packet count, not on real time.

  -n value
  --null value
      All packets are replaced by null packets after the specified packet
      number. Several --null options may be specified.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pass value
      All packets are passed unmodified after the specified packet number.
      Several --pass options may be specified. This is the default for the
      initial packets.

  --seconds
      With options --drop, --null, --pass and --stop, interpret the integer
      values as seconds from the beginning, not as packet numbers. Time is
      measured based on bitrate and packet count, not on real time.

  -s value
  --stop value
      Packet transmission stops after the specified packet number and tsp
      terminates.
