Permanently recompute bitrate based on PCR analysis

Usage: tsp -P pcrbitrate [options]

Options:

  -d
  --dts
      Use DTS (Decoding Time Stamps) from video PID's instead of PCR (Program
      Clock Reference) from the transport layer.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-errors
      Ignore transport stream errors such as discontinuities. When errors are
      not ignored (the default), the bitrate of the original stream (before
      corruptions) is evaluated. When errors are ignored, the bitrate of the
      received stream is evaluated, missing packets being considered as
      non-existent.

  --min-pcr value
      Stop analysis when that number of PCR are read from the required minimum
      number of PID (default: 128).

  --min-pid value
      Minimum number of PID to get PCR from (default: 1).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.
