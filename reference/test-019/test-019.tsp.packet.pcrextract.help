Extracts PCR, OPCR, PTS, DTS from TS packet for analysis

Usage: tsp -P pcrextract [options]

Options:

  -c
  --csv
      Report data in CSV (comma-separated values) format. All values are
      reported in decimal. This is the default output format. It is suitable
      for later analysis using tools such as Microsoft Excel.

  -d
  --dts
      Report Decoding Time Stamps (DTS). By default, if none of --pcr, --opcr,
      --pts, --dts is specified, report them all.

  -e
  --evaluate-pcr-offset
      Evaluate the offset from the PCR to PTS/DTS for packets with PTS/DTS but
      without PCR. This evaluation may be incorrect if the bitrate is not
      constant or incorrectly estimated. By default, the offset is reported
      only for packets containing a PTS/DTS and a PCR.

  -g
  --good-pts-only
      Keep only "good" PTS, ie. PTS which have a higher value than the previous
      good PTS. This eliminates PTS from out-of-sequence B-frames.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --input-timestamp
      Add an input timestamp of the corresponding TS packet, if available. This
      can be an RTP, SRT, kernel timestamp. It is always converted in PCR
      units.

  -l
  --log
      Report data in "log" format through the standard tsp logging system. All
      values are reported in hexadecimal.

  -n
  --noheader
      Do not output initial header line in CSV format.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --opcr
      Report Original Program Clock References (OPCR). By default, if none of
      --pcr, --opcr, --pts, --dts is specified, report them all.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Output file name for CSV reporting (standard error by default).

  --pcr
      Report Program Clock References (PCR). By default, if none of --pcr,
      --opcr, --pts, --dts is specified, report them all.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specifies PID's to analyze. By default, all PID's are analyzed. Several
      --pid options may be specified.

  --pts
      Report Presentation Time Stamps (PTS). By default, if none of --pcr,
      --opcr, --pts, --dts is specified, report them all.

  --scte35
      Detect and report PTS in SCTE 35 commands. Imply --log and --pts. If no
      --pid option is specified, detect all SCTE 35 PID's. If some --pid option
      is specified, report only SCTE PID's which are synchronized with the
      specified --pid options.

  -s string
  --separator string
      Field separator string in CSV output (default: ',').
