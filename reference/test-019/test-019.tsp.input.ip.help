Receive TS packets from UDP/IP, multicast or unicast

Usage: tsp -I ip [options] [address:]port

Parameter:

  The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive. The
  'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
  'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to listen
  on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast address. An
  optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:port' in the case
  of SSM.

Options:

  -b value
  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size in bytes (socket option).

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --disable-multicast-loop
      Disable multicast loopback. By default, incoming multicast packets are
      looped back on local interfaces, if an application sends packets to the
      same group from the same system. This option disables this.
      Warning: On input sockets, this option is effective only on Windows
      systems. On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, BSD), this option applies only to
      output sockets.

  -d value
  --display-interval value
      Specify the interval in seconds between two displays of the evaluated
      real-time input bitrate. The default is to never display the bitrate.
      This option is ignored if --evaluation-interval is not specified.

  -e value
  --evaluation-interval value
      Specify that the real-time input bitrate shall be evaluated on a regular
      basis. The value specifies the number of seconds between two evaluations.
      By default, the real-time input bitrate is never evaluated and the input
      bitrate is evaluated from the PCR in the input packets.

  -f
  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l ip-address
  --local-address ip-address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  --receive-timeout value
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  -s address[:port]
  --source address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

  --timestamp-priority name
      Specify how the input time-stamp of each packet is computed. The name
      specifies an ordered list. The first available time-stamp value is used
      as input time-stamp. The possible time-stamp sources are:
      - rtp : The RTP time stamp, when the UDP packet is an RTP packet.
      - kernel : A kernel-provided time-stamp for the packet, when available
      (Linux only).
      - tsp : A software time-stamp, provided by tsp when the input plugin
      returns a chunk of packets.
      The tsp-provided time-stamp is always available, always comes last and is
      less precise. The default is rtp-kernel-tsp.
      Must be one of "kernel-rtp-tsp", "kernel-tsp", "rtp-kernel-tsp",
      "rtp-tsp", "tsp".
