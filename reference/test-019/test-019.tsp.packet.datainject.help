DVB SimulCrypt data injector using EMMG/PDG <=> MUX protocol

Usage: tsp -P datainject [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate-max value
      Specifies the maximum bitrate for the data PID in bits / second. By
      default, the data PID bitrate is limited by the stuffing bitrate (data
      insertion is performed by replacing stuffing packets).
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --buffer-size value
      Specify the TCP and UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  -v value
  --emmg-mux-version value
      Specifies the version of the EMMG/PDG <=> MUX DVB SimulCrypt protocol.
      Valid values are 1 to 5. The default is 2.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --log-data[=level]
      Same as --log-protocol but applies to data_provision messages only. To
      debug the session management without being flooded by data messages, use
      --log-protocol=info --log-data=debug.
      The 'level' must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe",
      "verbose", "warning".

  --log-protocol[=level]
      Log all EMMG/PDG <=> MUX protocol messages using the specified level. If
      the option is not present, the messages are logged at debug level only.
      If the option is present without value, the messages are logged at info
      level. A level can be a numerical debug level or a name.
      The 'level' must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe",
      "verbose", "warning".

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specifies the PID for the data insertion. This option is mandatory.

  -q value
  --queue-size value
      Specifies the maximum number of sections or TS packets in the internal
      queue, ie. sections or packets which are received from the EMMG/PDG
      client but not yet inserted into the TS. The default is 1,000.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  -s [ip-address:]port
  --server [ip-address:]port
      Specifies the local TCP port on which the plugin listens for an incoming
      EMMG/PDG connection. This option is mandatory. When present, the optional
      address shall specify a local IP address or host name (by default, the
      plugin accepts connections on any local IP interface). This plugin
      behaves as a MUX, ie. a TCP server, and accepts only one EMMG/PDG
      connection at a time.

  -u [ip-address:]port
  --udp [ip-address:]port
      Specifies the local UDP port on which the plugin listens for data
      provision messages (these messages can be sent using TCP or UDP). By
      default, use the same port and optional local address as specified for
      TCP using option --server.

  --unregulated
      Insert data packets immediately. Do not regulate insertion, do not limit
      the data bitrate.
