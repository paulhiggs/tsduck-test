Boost the bitrate of a PID, stealing stuffing packets

Usage: tsp -P boostpid [options] pid addpkt inpkt

Parameters:

  The first parameter specifies the PID to boost.

  The second and third parameters specify that <addpkt> TS packets must be
  automatically added after every <inpkt> input TS packets in the PID. Both
  <addpkt> and <inpkt> must be non-zero integer values.

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.
