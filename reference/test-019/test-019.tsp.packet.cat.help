Perform various transformations on the CAT

Usage: tsp -P cat [options]

Options:

  -a casid/pid[/private-data]
  --add-ca-descriptor casid/pid[/private-data]
      Add a CA_descriptor in the CAT with the specified CA System Id and EMM
      PID. The optional private data must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.
      Several --add-ca-descriptor options may be specified to add several
      descriptors.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the CAT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty CAT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after milliseconds
      Create a new empty CAT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual CAT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the CAT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new CAT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the CAT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --patch-xml filename
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all tables on the fly. If
      the name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".
      Several --patch-xml options can be specified. Patch files are
      sequentially applied on each table.

  -r casid1[-casid2]
  --remove-casid casid1[-casid2]
      Remove all CA_descriptors with the specified CA System Id or range of
      ids. Several --remove-casid options may be specified.

  --remove-pid pid1[-pid2]
      Remove all CA_descriptors with the specified EMM PID value or range of
      values. Several --remove-pid options may be specified.
