Dump transport stream packets

Usage: tsp -P dump [options]

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --adaptation-field
      Include formatting of the adaptation field.

  -a
  --ascii
      Include ASCII dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b
  --binary
      Include binary dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt'. This is a handy shortcut when working on
      South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb'.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -h
  --headers-only
      Dump packet headers only, not payload.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese
      transport streams.

  -l
  --log
      Display a short one-line log of each packet instead of full dump.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed in each packet.
      The default is 188 bytes (complete packet).

  -n
  --nibble
      Same as --binary but add separator between 4-bit nibbles.

  --no-headers
      Do not display header information.

  --offset
      Include offset from start of packet with hexadecimal dump.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      Output file for dumped packets. By default, use the standard output.

  --payload
      Hexadecimal dump of TS payload only, skip TS header.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt'. This is a handy shortcut when working on
      Philippines transport streams.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Dump only packets with these PID values. Several --pid options may be
      specified. By default, all packets are displayed.

  --rs204
      Dump the 16-byte trailer as found in RS204 files.

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.
