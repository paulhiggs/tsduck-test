Duplicate PCR values from a PID into a new PCR-only PID

Usage: tsp -P pcrduplicate [options]

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

      required, there is no default value.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also

      packet processing plugins.

  -l value
  --reference-label value
      Packet label indicating the PID containing the reference PCR to
      duplicate. Each time a packet with that label is encountered, the
      reference PID switches to the PID of this packet, if different from the
      previous reference PID. At most one of --reference-pid and
      --reference-label shall be specified. By default, use the first PID
      containing a PCR.

  -r value
  --reference-pid value
      PID containing the reference PCR to duplicate. At most one of
      --reference-pid and --reference-label shall be specified. By default, use
      the first PID containing a PCR.
