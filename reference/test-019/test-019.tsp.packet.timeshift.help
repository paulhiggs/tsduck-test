Delay transmission by a fixed amount of packets

Usage: tsp -P timeshift [options]

Options:

  --directory directory-name
      Specify a directory where the temporary buffer file is created. By
      default, the system-specific area for temporary files is used. The
      temporary file is hidden and automatically deleted on termination.
      Specifying another location can be useful to redirect very large buffers
      to another disk. If the reserved memory area is large enough to hold the
      buffer, no file is created.

  -d
  --drop-initial
      Drop output packets during the initial phase, while the time-shift buffer
      is filling. By default, initial packets are replaced by null packets.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -m value
  --memory-packets value
      Specify the number of packets which are cached in memory. Having a larger
      memory cache improves the performances. By default, the size of the
      memory cache is 128 packets.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --packets value
      Specify the size of the time-shift buffer in packets. There is no
      default, the size of the buffer shall be specified either using --packets
      or --time.

  -t milliseconds
  --time milliseconds
      Specify the size of the time-shift buffer in milliseconds. The initial
      bitrate is used to convert this duration in number of packets and this
      value is used as fixed-size for the buffer. This is convenient only for
      constant bitrate (CBR) streams. There is no default, the size of the
      buffer shall be specified either using --packets or --time.
