Control Dektec devices

Usage: tsdektec [options] [device]

Parameter:

  Device index, from 0 to N-1 (with N being the number of Dektec devices in the
  system). The default is 0. Use option --all to have a complete list of
  devices in the system.

Options:

  -a
  --all
      List all Dektec devices available on the system.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i port-number
  --input port-number
      Set the specified port in input mode. This applies to bidirectional ports
      which can be either set in input or output mode.

  -j
  --json
      With --all, list the Dektec devices in JSON format (useful for automatic
      analysis).

  --json-buffer-size value
      With --json-tcp or --json-udp, specify the network socket send buffer
      size in bytes.

  --json-line[='prefix']
      Same as --json but report the JSON text as one single line in the message
      logger instead of the output file. The optional string parameter
      specifies a prefix to prepend on the log line before the JSON text to
      locate the appropriate line in the logs.

  --json-tcp ip-address:port
      Same as --json but report the JSON text as one single line in a TCP
      connection instead of the output file. The 'address' specifies an IP
      address or a host name that translates to an IP address. The 'port'
      specifies the destination TCP port. By default, a new TCP connection is
      established each time a JSON message is produced. Be aware that a
      complete TCP connection cycle may introduce some latency in the
      processing. If latency is an issue, consider using --json-udp.

  --json-tcp-keep
      With --json-tcp, keep the TCP connection open for all JSON messages. By
      default, a new TCP connection is established each time a JSON message is
      produced.

  --json-udp ip-address:port
      Same as --json but report the JSON text as one single line in a UDP
      datagram instead of the output file. The 'address' specifies an IP
      address which can be either unicast or multicast. It can be also a host
      name that translates to an IP address. The 'port' specifies the
      destination UDP port. Be aware that the size of UDP datagrams is limited
      by design to 64 kB. If larger JSON contents are expected, consider using
      --json-tcp.

  --json-udp-local ip-address
      With --json-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --json-udp-ttl value
      With --json-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The
      actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on
      the destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on
      most systems.

  -l state
  --led state
      Set the state of the LED on the rear panel. Useful to identify a Dektec
      device when more than one is present. See also option --wait (the led
      state is automatically returned to "hardware" after exit).
      Must be one of "blue", "green", "hardware", "off", "red", "yellow".

  -n
  --normalized
      With --all, list the Dektec devices in a normalized output format (useful
      for automatic analysis).

  -o port-number
  --output port-number
      Set the specified port in output mode. This applies to bidirectional
      ports which can be either set in input or output mode.

  -p value
  --power-mode value
      On DTU-315 USB modulators, set the power mode to the specified value.
      Must be one of "high-quality", "low-power".

  -r
  --reset
      Reset the device.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  -w seconds
  --wait seconds
      Wait the specified number of seconds before exiting. The default if 5
      seconds if option --led is specified and 0 otherwise.
