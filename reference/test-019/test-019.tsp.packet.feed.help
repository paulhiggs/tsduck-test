Extract an encapsulated TS from an outer feed TS

Usage: tsp -P feed [options]

Options:

  -a
  --append
      With --output-file, if the file already exists, append to the end of the
      file. By default, existing files are overwritten.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -k
  --keep
      With --output-file, keep existing file (abort if the specified file
      already exists). By default, existing files are overwritten.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify that the extracted stream is saved in this file. In that case,
      the outer transport stream is passed unchanged to the next plugin. By
      default, the extracted stream completely replaces the outer stream.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID carrying the inner encapsulated stream. By default, use
      the first identified encapsulated stream.

  --service-type value
      Specify the service type carrying inner encapsulated streams. By default,
      use 0x80.

  --stream-type value
      Specify the stream type carrying inner encapsulated streams inside a
      service. By default, use 0x90.
