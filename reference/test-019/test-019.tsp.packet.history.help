Report a history of major events on the transport stream

Usage: tsp -P history [options]

Options:

  -c
  --cas
      Report all CAS events (ECM, crypto-periods).

  -e
  --eit
      Report all EIT. By default, EIT are not reported.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-stream-id-change
      Do not report stream_id modifications in a stream. Some subtitle streams
      may constantly swap between "private stream" and "padding stream". This
      option suppresses these annoying messages.

  -m
  --milli-seconds
      For each message, report time in milli-seconds from the beginning of the
      stream instead of the TS packet number. This time is a playback time
      based on the current TS bitrate (use plugin pcrbitrate when necessary).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output file for reporting history lines. By default, report
      history lines on standard error using the tsp logging mechanism.

      Without option --output-file, output is formated as:
      * history: PKT#: MESSAGE

      Some messages may be out of sync. To sort messages according to their
      packet numbers, use a command like:
      tsp -P history ...  2>&1 | grep '* history:' | sort -t : -k 2 -n

      When an output file is specified using --output-file, the sort command
      becomes:
      sort -n output-file-name

  -s value
  --suspend-packet-threshold value
      Number of packets in TS after which a PID is considered as suspended. By
      default, if no packet is found in a PID during 60 seconds, the PID is
      considered as suspended.

  -t
  --time-all
      Report all TDT and TOT. By default, only report TDT preceeding another
      event.
