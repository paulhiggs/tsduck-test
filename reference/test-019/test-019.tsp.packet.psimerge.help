Merge PSI/SI from mixed streams

Usage: tsp -P psimerge [options]

This plugin assumes that the PSI/SI for two independent streams are multiplexed
in the same transport streams but the packets from each original stream are
independently labelled. This plugin merges the PSI/SI from these two streams
into one.

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  --main-label value
      Specify the label which is set on packets from the 'main' stream. The
      maximum label value is 31. By default, the main stream is made of packets
      without label. At least one of --main-label and --merge-label must be
      specified.

  --merge-label value
      Specify the label which is set on packets from the 'merge' stream. The
      maximum label value is 31. By default, the merge stream is made of
      packets without label. At least one of --main-label and --merge-label
      must be specified.

  --no-bat
      Do not merge the BAT.

  --no-cat
      Do not merge the CAT.

  --no-eit
      Do not merge the EIT's.

  --no-nit
      Do not merge the NIT Actual.

  --no-pat
      Do not merge the PAT.

  --no-sdt
      Do not merge the SDT Actual.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --time-from-merge
      Use the TDT/TOT time reference from the 'merge' stream. By default, use
      the TDT/TOT time reference from the 'main' stream.
