Update TDT and TOT with a new time reference

Usage: tsp -P timeref [options]

Options:

  -a seconds
  --add seconds
      Add the specified number of seconds to all UTC time. Specify a negative
      value to make the time reference go backward.

  --eit
      Update events start time in EIT's. By default, EIT's are not modified.
      When --add is used, the specified offset is applied to all events start
      time. When --start is used, EIT's are dropped until the first TDT or TOT
      is encountered. Then, the difference between the first TDT or TOT time
      and the new time reference at this point is applied.

  --eit-date-only
      Same as --eit but update the date field only in the event start dates in
      EIT's. The hour, minute and second fields of the event start dates are
      left unchanged.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -l minutes
  --local-time-offset minutes
      Specify a new local time offset in minutes to set in the TOT. The allowed
      range is -720 to 720 (from -12 hours to +12 hours). By default, the local
      time offset is unchanged.

  --next-change value
      Specify a new UTC date & time for the next DST change. The time value
      must be in the format "year/month/day:hour:minute:second". By default,
      the time of next DST change is unmodified.

  --next-time-offset minutes
      Specify a new local time offset to be applied after the next DST change.
      The value is in minutes, similar to --local-time-offset. By default, the
      next time offset is unchanged.

  --notdt
      Do not update TDT.

  --notot
      Do not update TOT.

  --only-country name
      Restrict the modification of --local-time-offset, --next-change and
      --next-time-offset to the specified 3-letter country code. Several
      --only-country options are allowed.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --only-region id1[-id2]
      Restrict the modification of --local-time-offset, --next-change and
      --next-time-offset to the specified region id inside a country. Several
      --only-region options are allowed.

  -s value
  --start value
      Specify a new UTC date & time reference for the first packet in the
      stream. Then, the time reference is updated according to the number of
      packets and the bitrate. The time value can be in the format
      "year/month/day:hour:minute:second", or use the predefined name "system"
      for getting current time from the system clock.

  --system-synchronous
      Keep the TDT and TOT time synchronous with the system clock. Each time a
      TDT or TOT is updated, the system clock value is used. It implicitely
      uses '--start system'. If --start is specified with a specific date, the
      difference between that date and the initial UTC system clock is stored.
      This offset is then consistently applied to the current system clock in
      all TDT and TOT. Note: this option is meaningful on live streams only. It
      is useless on offline file processing.
