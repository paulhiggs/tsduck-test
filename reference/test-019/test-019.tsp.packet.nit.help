Perform various transformations on the NIT

Usage: tsp -P nit [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the NIT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --build-service-list-descriptors
      Build service_list_descriptors in the NIT according to the information
      which is collected in the PAT and the SDT. See also option
      --default-service-type.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty NIT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after milliseconds
      Create a new empty NIT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual NIT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --default-service-type value
      With --build-service-list-descriptors, specify the default service type
      of services which are found in the PAT but not in the SDT. By default,
      services without known service type are not added in created service list
      descriptors.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --expand-patch-xml
      Expand all environment variables in the patch files before patching. The
      expansion is performed each time a patch file is used. Therefore, if the
      values of the environment variables changed between two usages of the
      patch file, the latest up-to-date environment values are always used.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the NIT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new NIT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  -l value
  --lcn value
      Specify which operation to perform on logical_channel_number (LCN)
      descriptors. The value is a positive integer:
      1: Remove all LCN descriptors.
      2: Remove one entry every two entries in each LCN descriptor.
      3: Duplicate one entry every two entries in each LCN descriptor.

  --mpe-fec value
      Set the "MPE-FEC indicator" in the terrestrial delivery system
      descriptors to the specified value (0 or 1).

  --network-id id
      Set the specified new value as network id in the NIT.

  --network-name name
      Set the specified value as network name in the NIT. Any existing
      network_name_descriptor is removed. A new network_name_descriptor is
      created with the new name.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the NIT.

  --nit-other id
      Same as --other (for compatibility).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --original-network-id id
      Set the specified new value as original network id of all TS in the NIT.

  -o id
  --other id
      Do not modify the NIT Actual. Modify the NIT Other with the specified
      network id.

  --patch-xml filename
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all tables on the fly. If
      the name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".
      Several --patch-xml options can be specified. Patch files are
      sequentially applied on each table.

  --pds value
      With option --remove-descriptor, specify the private data specifier which
      applies to the descriptor tag values above 0x80.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID on which the NIT is expected. By default, use PID 16.

  --remove-descriptor value
      Remove from the NIT all descriptors with the specified tag. Several
      --remove-descriptor options may be specified to remove several types of
      descriptors. See also option --pds.

  -r value
  --remove-service value
      Remove the specified service_id from the following descriptors:
      service_list_descriptor, logical_channel_number_descriptor. Several
      --remove-service options may be specified to remove several services.

  --remove-ts value
      Remove the specified ts_id from the NIT. Several --remove-ts options may
      be specified to remove several TS.

  -s value
  --sld value
      Specify which operation to perform on service_list_descriptors. The value
      is a positive integer:
      1: Remove all service_list_descriptors.
      2: Remove one entry every two entries in each descriptor.

  --time-slicing value
      Set the "time slicing indicator" in the terrestrial delivery system
      descriptors to the specified value (0 or 1).
