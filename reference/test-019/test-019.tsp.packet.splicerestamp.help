Restamp PTS in SCTE 35 splice information

Usage: tsp -P splicerestamp [options]

Options:

  -c
  --continuous
      With --old-pcr-pid and --new-pcr-pid, continuously recompute the PTS
      adjustment between the old and new clock references. By default, the PTS
      adjustment is computed once only, using the first adjacent pair of old
      and new PCR values. This is the preferred method when transcoding
      introduces a drift in muxing the old and new PCR PID's.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -n value
  --new-pcr-pid value
      Specify the PID carrying the PCR which must be used as the new reference
      clock by the splice commands on output. Must be used with --old-pcr-pid.

  -o value
  --old-pcr-pid value
      Specify the PID carrying the PCR which was used as reference clock by the
      splice commands on input. Must be used with --new-pcr-pid.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID carrying SCTE-35 sections to restamp. By default, the
      first SCTE-35 PID is selected.

  -a value
  --pts-adjustment value
      Add the specified value to the pts_adjustment field in the splice
      sections.

  -r
  --replace
      Replace the value of the pts_adjustment field in the splice sections.
      Ignore the previous value instead of adding it.
