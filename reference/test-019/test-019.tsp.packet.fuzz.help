Introduce random errors in the transport stream

Usage: tsp -P fuzz [options]

Options:

  -c value
  --corrupt-probability value
      Probability to corrupt a byte in the transport stream. The default is
      zero, meaning no corruption.
      The value must be a fraction of two 32-bit integers.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Corrupt only packets with these PID values. Several --pid options may be
      specified. By default, all packets can be corrupted.

  -s hexa-data
  --seed hexa-data
      Initial seed for the pseudo-random number generator. Specify hexadecimal
      data. The size is not limited but at least 32 bytes are recommended.
      Using the same seed on the same TS file will result in exactly the same
      corruptions. Without this parameter, a random seed is used and the
      corruptions cannot be identically reproduced.

  --sync-byte
      May corrupt the 0x47 sync byte in TS packets. This may invalidate the
      synchronization of the transport stream. By default, sync bytes are
      preserved.
