Adjust PCR's according to a constant bitrate

Usage: tsp -P pcradjust [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify a constant bitrate for the transport stream. The PCR values will
      be adjusted according to this bitrate. By default, use the input bitrate
      as reported by the input device or a previous plugin.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  --ignore-dts
      Do not modify DTS (decoding time stamps) values. By default, the DTS are
      modified according to the PCR adjustment.

  --ignore-pts
      Do not modify PTS (presentation time stamps) values. By default, the PTS
      are modified according to the PCR adjustment.

  --ignore-scrambled
      Do not modify PCR values on PID's containing scrambled packets. By
      default, on scrambled PID's, the PCR's are modified but not the PTS and
      DTS since they are scrambled. This may result in problems when playing
      video and audio.

  --min-ms-interval milliseconds
      Specify the minimum interval between two PCR's in milliseconds. On a
      given PID, if the interval between two PCR's is larger than the minimum,
      the next null packet will be replaced with an empty packet with a PCR for
      that PID.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specifies PID's where PCR, DTS and PTS values shall be adjusted. By
      default, all PID's are modified. Several --pid options may be specified.
