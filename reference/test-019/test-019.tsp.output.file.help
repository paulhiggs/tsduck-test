Write packets to a file

Usage: tsp -O file [options] [file-name]

Parameter:

  Name of the created output file. Use standard output by default.

Options:

  --add-start-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically inserted at
      the start of the output file, before what comes from the previous
      plugins.

  --add-stop-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically appended at
      the end of the output file, after what comes from the previous plugins.

  -a
  --append
      If the file already exists, append to the end of the file. By default,
      existing files are overwritten.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the output TS file. By default, the format is a
      standard TS file.
      Must be one of "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -k
  --keep
      Keep existing file (abort if the specified file already exists). By
      default, existing files are overwritten.

  --max-duration seconds
      Specify a maximum duration in seconds during which an output file is
      written. After the specified duration, the output file is closed and
      another one is created. A timestamp is automatically added to the name
      part so that successive output files receive distinct names. Example: if
      the specified file name is foo.ts, the various files are named
      foo-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.ts.

      The options --max-duration and --max-size are mutually exclusive.

  --max-files value
      With --max-duration or --max-size, specify a maximum number of files.
      When the number of created files exceeds the specified number, the oldest
      files are deleted. By default, all created files are kept.

  --max-retry value
      With --reopen-on-error, specify the maximum number of times the file is
      reopened on error. By default, the file is indefinitely reopened.

  --max-size value
      Specify a maximum size in bytes for the output files. When an output file
      grows beyond the specified limit, it is closed and another one is
      created. A number is automatically added to the name part so that
      successive output files receive distinct names. Example: if the specified
      file name is foo.ts, the various files are named foo-000000.ts,
      foo-000001.ts, etc.

      If the specified template already contains trailing digits, this
      unmodified name is used for the first file. Then, the integer part is
      incremented. Example: if the specified file name is foo-027.ts, the
      various files are named foo-027.ts, foo-028.ts, etc.

      The options --max-duration and --max-size are mutually exclusive.

  -r
  --reopen-on-error
      In case of write error, close the file and try to reopen it several
      times. After a write error, attempt to reopen or recreate the file
      immediately. Then, in case of open error, periodically retry to open the
      file. See also options --retry-interval and --max-retry.

  --retry-interval milliseconds
      With --reopen-on-error, specify the delay to wait before attempting to
      reopen the file after a failure. The default is 2,000 ms.
