Copy and synchronize PCR's from one PID to another

Usage: tsp -P pcrcopy [options]

Options:

  -e packet-count
  --every packet-count
      Insert a PCR every N packets in the target PID. By default, insert a PCR
      in packets with a payload unit start only.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  --max-shift bytes
      Maximum number of target packet payload bytes which can be shifted, due
      to PCR insertion. When this value is reached, usually because of a lack
      of null packets, the current PES packet is truncated. By default, allow
      the buffering of up to 16 packet payloads.

  -n
  --no-pusi
      Do not insert a PCR in packets with a payload unit start indicator
      (PUSI). By default, a PCR is inserted in all PUSI packets, even if
      --every is also specified.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --reference-label value
      Packet label indicating the PID containing the reference PCR to copy.
      Each time a packet with that label is encountered, the reference PID
      switches to the PID of this packet, if different from the previous
      reference PID. Exactly one of --reference-pid and --reference-label shall
      be specified.

  -r value
  --reference-pid value
      PID containing the reference PCR to copy. Exactly one of --reference-pid
      and --reference-label shall be specified.

  --target-label value
      Packet label indicating the PID containing the target PID into which PCR
      shall be created and copied. Each time a packet with that label is
      encountered, the target PID switches to the PID of this packet, if
      different from the previous target PID. Exactly one of --target-pid and
      --target-label shall be specified.

  -t value
  --target-pid value
      PID into which PCR shall be created and copied. Exactly one of
      --target-pid and --target-label shall be specified.
