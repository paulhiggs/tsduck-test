Build specifically crafted input packets

Usage: tsp -I craft [options]

Options:

  --cc value
      Specify the initial value of the continuity_counter field (0 by default).

  --constant-cc
      Do not increment the continuity counter. By default, the continuity
      counter in incremented when the packet has a payload.

  -c value
  --count value
      Specify the number of crafted packets to generate. After the last packet,
      an end-of-file condition is generated. By default, if --count is not
      specified, crafted packets are generated endlessly.

  --discontinuity
      Set the discontinuity_indicator in the packets. An adaptation field is
      created.

  --error
      Set the transport_error_indicator in the packets.

  --es-priority
      Set the elementary_stream_priority_indicator in the packets. An
      adaptation field is created.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      When the number of crafted packets is specified, perform a "joint
      termination" when completed instead of unconditional termination. See
      "tsp --help" for more details on "joint termination".

  --no-payload
      Do not use a payload.

  --opcr value
      Set this OPCR value in the packets. An adaptation field is created.

  --payload-pattern hexa-data
      Specify the binary pattern to apply on packets payload. The value must be
      a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes. The
      pattern is repeated to fill the payload. The default is FF.

  --payload-size size
      Specify the size of the packet payload in bytes. When necessary, an
      adaptation field is created. Note that --payload-size 0 specifies that a
      payload exists with a zero size. This is different from --no-payload
      which also specifies that the payload does not exist. By default, the
      payload uses all free space in the packet.

  --pcr value
      Set this PCR value in the packets. An adaptation field is created.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID for the packets (0 by default).

  --priority
      Set the transport_priority flag in the packets.

  --private-data hexa-data
      Specify the binary content of the transport_private_data in the
      adaptation field. The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits
      specifying any number of bytes.

  --pusi
      Set the payload_unit_start_indicator in the packets.

  --random-access
      Set the random_access_indicator in the packets. An adaptation field is
      created.

  --rs204 hexa-data
      Generate a 204-byte packet and specify the binary content to store in the
      16-byte trailer. The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits
      specifying up to 16 bytes. If the data are shorter than 16 bytes, they
      are padded with 0xFF.

  --scrambling value
      Specify the value of the transport_scrambling_control field (0 by
      default).

  --splice-countdown value
      Create a splicing point and set this splice countdown value in the
      packets. An adaptation field is created.
