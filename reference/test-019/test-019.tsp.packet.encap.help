Encapsulate packets from several PID's into one single PID

Usage: tsp -P encap [options]

Options:

  --drop-initial
      In synchronous PES mode, all outer packets must contain a PTS. However, a
      PTS cannot be computed before getting the first PCR. If initial input
      packets arrive before the first PCR, they cannot be immediately
      encapsulated. By default, they are delayed until the first PCR is found,
      when PTS can be computed. Using this option, these initial input packets
      are dropped instead of being delayed.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -i
  --ignore-errors
      Ignore errors such as PID conflict or packet overflow. By default, a PID
      conflict is reported when the output PID is already present on input but
      not encapsulated. A packet overflow is reported when the input stream
      does not contain enough null packets to absorb the encapsulation
      overhead.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Encapsulate packets with the specified labels. Several --label options
      may be specified.

  -m value
  --max-buffered-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of buffered packets. The buffered packets are
      produced by the encapsulation overhead. An overflow is usually caused by
      insufficient null packets in the input stream. The default is 1,024
      packets.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o value
  --output-pid value
      Specify the output PID containing all encapsulated PID's. This is a
      mandatory parameter, there is no default. The null PID 0x1FFF cannot be
      the output PID.

  --pack[=value]
      Emit outer packets when they are full only. By default, emit outer
      packets as soon as possible, when null packets are available on input.
      With the default behavior, inner packets are decapsulated with a better
      time accuracy, at the expense of a higher bitrate of the outer PID when
      there are many null packets in input. You can limit the distance between
      packets adding a positive value. With a 0 value the distance is disabled
      (=unlimited). The value 1 is equivalent to not use the pack mode.

  --pcr-label value
      Specify a label for reference packets containing PCR's. The output PID
      will contain PCR's, based on the same clock. By default, the output PID
      does not contain any PCR.

  --pcr-pid value
      Specify a reference PID containing PCR's. The output PID will contain
      PCR's, based on the same clock. By default, the output PID does not
      contain any PCR.

  --pes-mode mode
      Enable PES mode encapsulation.
      The 'mode' must be one of "disabled", "fixed", "variable".

  --pes-offset value
      Offset used in Synchronous PES mode encapsulation. The value (positive or
      negative) is added to the current PCR to generate the PTS timestamp
      inserted in the PES header. The recommended values are between -90000 and
      +90000 (1 second). It requires to use the PCR option (--pcr-pid or
      --pcr-label). The value 0 is equivalent to use the Asynchronous PES
      encapsulation.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specify an input PID or range of PID's to encapsulate. Several --pid
      options can be specified. The null PID 0x1FFF cannot be encapsulated.
