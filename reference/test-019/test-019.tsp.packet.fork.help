Fork a process and send TS packets to its standard input

Usage: tsp -P fork [options] 'command'

Parameter:

  Specifies the command line to execute in the created process.

Options:

  -b value
  --buffered-packets value
      Specifies the number of TS packets to buffer before sending them through
      the pipe to the forked process. When set to zero, the packets are not
      buffered and sent one by one. The default is 500 packets in real-time
      mode and 1000 packets in offline mode.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the output TS file. By default, the format is a
      standard TS file.
      The 'name' must be one of "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-abort
      Ignore early termination of child process. By default, if the child
      process aborts and no longer reads the packets, tsp also aborts.

  -n
  --nowait
      Do not wait for child process termination at end of input.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.
