Limit the global bitrate by dropping packets

Usage: tsp -P limit [options]

This plugin limits the global bitrate of the transport stream. Packets are
dropped when necessary to maintain the overall bitrate below a given maximum.
The bitrate is computed from PCR's (the default) or from the processing wall
clock time.

Packets are not dropped randomly. Some packets are more likely to be dropped
than others. When the bitrate exceeds the maximum, the number of packets in
excess is permanently recomputed. The type of packets to drop depends on the
number of packets in excess. There are several thresholds which are specified
by the corresponding options:

- Below --threshold1, only null packets are dropped.
- Below --threshold2, if --pid options are specified, video packets from the
specified PID's are dropped (except packets containing a PUSI or a PCR).
- Below --threshold3, if --pid options are specified, packets from the
specified PID's are dropped (except packets containing a PUSI or a PCR).
- Below --threshold4, packets from any video or audio PID are dropped (except
packets containing a PUSI or a PCR).
- Above the last threshold, any packet can be dropped.

Note: All thresholds, except the last one, can be disabled using a 0 value.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Limit the overall bitrate of the transport stream to the specified value
      in bits/second. This is a mandatory option, there is no default.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specify PID's the content of which can be dropped when the maximum
      bitrate is exceeded. Several --pid options can be specified.

  -1 value
  --threshold1 value
      Specify the first threshold for the number of packets in excess. The
      default is 10 packets.

  -2 value
  --threshold2 value
      Specify the second threshold for the number of packets in excess. The
      default is 100 packets.

  -3 value
  --threshold3 value
      Specify the third threshold for the number of packets in excess. The
      default is 500 packets.

  -4 value
  --threshold4 value
      Specify the fourth threshold for the number of packets in excess. The
      default is 1000 packets.

  -w
  --wall-clock
      Compute bitrates based on real wall-clock time. The option is meaningful
      with live streams only. By default, compute bitrates based on PCR's.
