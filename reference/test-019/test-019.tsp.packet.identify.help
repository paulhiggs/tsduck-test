Identify PID's based on various criteria

Usage: tsp -P identify [options]

Options:

  --all-set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on all packets of all PID's in the TS after
      identifying the first PID. See also the option --set-label.

  -a
  --audio
      Identify all PID's carrying audio.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -l language-code
  --language language-code
      With --audio or --subtitles, identify PID's carrying the specified
      language. The specified name must be a 3-character ISO-639 language code.

  --log
      Log a message on each newly identified PID. This is the default when
      nothing else is specified (--set-label --all-set-label
      --set-environment-variable).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p
  --pmt
      Identify all PID's carrying PMT's.

  --scte-35
      Identify all PID's carrying SCTE-35 splice commands.

  -s name-or-id
  --service name-or-id
      Identify all PID's belonging to the specified service. If the argument is
      an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored.

  --set-environment-variable name
      When a PID is identified, define the specific environment variable with
      this PID value. This environment variable can be reused in a XML patch
      file in another plugin, downstream the chain, for instance. It is
      recommended to use this option only when one PID will be identified. When
      several PID's are identified, the environment variable is redefined for
      each new identified PID and using the environment variable later produces
      different results.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on all packets of the identified PID's. Several
      --set-label options may be specified, all labels are set on all
      identified PID's.

  --subtitles
      Identify all PID's carrying subtitles.

  -v
  --video
      Identify all PID's carrying video.
