Filter TS packets according to various conditions

Usage: tsp -P filter [options]

Options:

  --adaptation-field
      Select packets with an adaptation field.

  --after-packets count
      Let the first 'count' packets pass transparently without filtering. Start
      to apply the filtering criteria after that number of packets.

  --audio
      Select packets from an audio PID.

  -c
  --clear
      Select clear (unscrambled) packets. Equivalent to --scrambling-control 0.

  --codec name
      Select packets from PID's which were encoded with the specified codec
      format.
      The 'name' must be one of "AAC", "AC3", "AC4", "AV1", "AVC", "AVS2Audio",
      "AVS3Audio", "AVS3Video", "DTS", "DTSHD", "DVBSubtitles", "EAC3", "EVC",
      "H264", "H265", "H266", "HEAAC", "HEVC", "JPEG2000", "LCEVC", "MP1Audio",
      "MP1Video", "MP2Audio", "MP2Video", "MP3", "MP4Video", "MPEG-1-Audio",
      "MPEG-1-Video", "MPEG-2-Audio", "MPEG-2-Video", "MPEG-4-Video",
      "Teletext", "undefined", "VP9", "VVC".

  --ecm
      Select packets from any ECM PID.

  --emm
      Select packets from any EMM PID.

  --every count
      Select one packet every that number of packets.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --has-splice-countdown
      Select packets which contain a splice_countdown value in adaptation
      field.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --input-stuffing
      Select packets which were articially inserted as stuffing before the
      input plugin (using tsp options --add-start-stuffing,
      --add-input-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing). Be aware that these
      packets may no longer be null packets if some previous plugin injected
      data, replacing stuffing.

  -i index1[-[index2]]
  --interval index1[-[index2]]
      Select all packets in the specified interval from the start of the
      stream. The packets in the stream are indexed starting at zero. In the
      form 'index1', only one packet is selected, at the specified index. In
      the form 'index1-index2', all packets in the specified range of indexes,
      inclusive, are selected. In the form 'index1-', all packets starting at
      the specified index are selected, up to the end of the stream. Several
      options --interval can be specified.

  --intra-frame
      Select packets which contain the start of a video intra-frame. The
      accurate detection of intra-frame depends on the codec. There is also a
      minimal risk of false positive on non-video PID's.

  --isdb-layer layer1[-layer2]
      Select packets with any of the specified layer indicator values in the
      ISDB-T Information structure. This structure is located in the 16-byte
      trailer, after the 188-byte TS packet. Therefore, using that filter is
      only possible if the input transport stream is made of 204-byte packets.
      Several options --isdb-layer can be specified.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Select packets with any of the specified labels. Labels should have
      typically been set by a previous plugin in the chain. Several --label
      options may be specified.

      Note that the option --label is different from the generic option
      --only-label. The generic option --only-label acts at tsp level and
      controls which packets are passed to the plugin. All other packets are
      directly passed to the next plugin without going through this plugin. The
      option --label, on the other hand, is specific to the filter plugin and
      selects packets with specific labels among the packets which are passed
      to this plugin.

  --max-adaptation-field-size value
      Select packets with no adaptation field or with an adaptation field the
      size (in bytes) of which is not greater than the specified value.

  --max-payload-size value
      Select packets with no payload or with a payload the size (in bytes) of
      which is not greater than the specified value.

  --max-splice-countdown value
      Select packets with a splice_countdown value in adaptation field which is
      lower than or equal to the specified value.

  --min-adaptation-field-size value
      Select packets with an adaptation field the size (in bytes) of which is
      equal to or greater than the specified value.

  --min-payload-size value
      Select packets with a payload the size (in bytes) of which is equal to or
      greater than the specified value.

  --min-splice-countdown value
      Select packets with a splice_countdown value in adaptation field which is
      greater than or equal to the specified value.

  -n
  --negate
      Negate the filter: specified packets are excluded.

  --nullified
      Select packets which were explicitly turned into null packets by some
      previous plugin in the chain (typically using a --stuffing option).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --pattern hexa-data
      Select packets containing the specified pattern bytes. The value must be
      a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes. By
      default, the packet is selected when the value is anywhere inside the
      packet. With option --search-payload, only search the pattern in the
      payload of the packet. With option --search-offset, the packet is
      selected only if the pattern is at the specified offset in the packet.
      When --search-payload and --search-offset are both specified, the packet
      is selected only if the pattern is at the specified offset in the
      payload.

  --payload
      Select packets with a payload.

  --pcr
      Select packets with PCR or OPCR.

  --pes
      Select packets with clear PES headers.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified.

  --psi-si
      Select packets from any PSI/SI PID.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the selected packets. Do not drop
      unselected packets, simply clear labels on selected ones. Several
      --reset-label options may be specified.

  --reset-permanent-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on all packets, selected and unselected ones,
      after at least one was selected. Do not drop unselected packets, simply
      use selected ones as trigger. Several --reset-permanent-label options may
      be specified.

  --scrambling-control value
      Select packets with the specified scrambling control value. Valid values
      are 0 (clear), 1 (reserved), 2 (even key), 3 (odd key).

  --search-offset value
      With --pattern, only search the set of bytes at the specified offset in
      the packet (the default) or in the payload (with --search-payload).

  --search-payload
      With --pattern, only search the set of bytes in the payload of the
      packet. Do not search the pattern in the header or adaptation field.

  --service id-or-name
      Select packets belonging to any of the specified services as PMT,
      component or ECM. If the argument is an integer, it is considered as a
      service id. Otherwise, this is a service name. Several --service options
      may be specified.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the selected packets. Do not drop unselected
      packets, simply mark selected ones. Several --set-label options may be
      specified.

  --set-permanent-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on all packets, selected and unselected ones,
      after at least one was selected. Do not drop unselected packets, simply
      use selected ones as trigger. Several --set-permanent-label options may
      be specified.

  --splice-countdown value
      Select packets with the specified splice_countdown value in adaptation
      field.

  --stream-id id1[-id2]
      Select PES PID's with any of the specified stream ids. A PID starts to be
      selected when a specified stream id appears. Such a PID is no longer
      selected when non-specified stream id is found. Several --stream-id
      options may be specified.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  --subtitles
      Select packets from a subtitles PID.

  --unit-start
      Select packets with payload unit start indicator.

  -v
  --valid
      Select valid packets. A valid packet starts with 0x47 and has its
      transport_error_indicator cleared.

  --video
      Select packets from a video PID.
