Generic PID remapper

Usage: tsp -P remap [options] [pid[-pid]=newpid ...]

Parameters:

  Each remapping is specified as "pid=newpid" or "pid1-pid2=newpid" (all PID's
  can be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values). In the first form, the
  PID "pid" is remapped to "newpid". In the latter form, all PID's within the
  range "pid1" to "pid2" (inclusive) are respectively remapped to "newpid",
  "newpid"+1, etc. This behaviour can be changed using option --single. The
  null PID 0x1FFF cannot be remapped.

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  -n
  --no-psi
      Do not modify the PSI. By default, the PAT, CAT and PMT's are modified so
      that previous references to the remapped PID's will point to the new PID
      values.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the remapped packets. Several --reset-label
      options may be specified.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the remapped packets. Several --set-label
      options may be specified.

  -s
  --single
      When a remapping is in the form "pid1-pid2=newpid", remap all input PID's
      to the same "newpid" value, not "newpid", "newpid"+1, etc. This option
      forces --unchecked since distinct PID's are remapped to the same one.

  -u
  --unchecked
      Do not perform any consistency checking while remapping PID's; remapping
      two PID's to the same PID or to a PID which is already present in the
      input is accepted. Note that this option should be used with care since
      the resulting stream can be illegal or inconsistent.
