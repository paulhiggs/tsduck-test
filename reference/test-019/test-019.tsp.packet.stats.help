Report various statistics on PID's and labels

Usage: tsp -P stats [options]

Options:

  -c
  --csv
      Report the statistics in CSV (comma-separated values) format. All values
      are reported in decimal. It is suitable for later analysis using tools
      such as Microsoft Excel.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i seconds
  --interval seconds
      Produce a new output file at regular intervals. The interval value is in
      seconds. After outputting a file, the statistics are reset, ie. each
      output file contains a fully independent analysis.

  -l label1[-label2]
  --label label1[-label2]
      Analyze packets with the specified label or range of labels. Several -l
      or --label options may be specified. By default, all PID's are analyzed.
      The options --label and --pid are mutually exclusive.

  --log
      Report the statistics in the common transport stream logger, not in a
      file.

  -m
  --multiple-files
      When used with --interval and --output-file, create a new file for each
      statistics report instead of rewriting the previous file. Assuming that
      the specified output file name has the form 'base.ext', each file is
      created with a time stamp in its name as 'base-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.ext'.

  -n
  --noheader
      Do not output initial header line in CSV and text format.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      Specify the output text file for the analysis result. By default, use the
      standard output.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Analyze the specified PID or range of PID's. Several -p or --pid options
      may be specified. By default, all PID's are analyzed.

  -s string
  --separator string
      Field separator string in CSV output (default: ',').
