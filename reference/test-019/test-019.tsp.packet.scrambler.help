DVB scrambler

Usage: tsp -P scrambler [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the optional service to scramble. If no service is specified, a
  list of PID's to scramble must be provided using --pid options. When PID's
  are provided, fixed control words must be specified as well.

  If no fixed CW is specified, a random CW is generated for each crypto-period
  and ECM's containing the current and next CW's are created and inserted in
  the stream. ECM's can be created only when a service is specified.

  If the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
  interpreted as a service id. If it is an empty string or "-", the first
  service in the PAT is scrambled. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service
  name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are
  ignored. If the input TS does not contain an SDT, use service ids only.

Options:

  -a hexa-data
  --access-criteria hexa-data
      Specifies the access criteria for the service as sent to the ECMG. The
      value must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.

  --aes-cbc
      Use AES-CBC scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default). The control
      words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte. The residue is left clear.
      Specify a fixed initialization vector using the --iv option.

      Note that this is a non-standard TS scrambling mode. The only standard
      AES-based scrambling modes are ATIS-IDSA and DVB-CISSA (DVB-CISSA is the
      same as AES-CBC with a DVB-defined IV). The TSDuck scrambler
      automatically sets the scrambling_descriptor with user-defined value
      0xF0.

  --aes-ctr
      Use AES-CTR scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default). The control
      words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte. The residue is included in the
      scrambling. Specify a fixed initialization vector using the --iv option.
      See the option --ctr-counter-bits for the size of the counter part in the
      IV.

      Note that this is a non-standard TS scrambling mode. The only standard
      AES-based scrambling modes are ATIS-IDSA and DVB-CISSA. The TSDuck
      scrambler automatically sets the scrambling_descriptor with user-defined
      value 0xF1.

  --atis-idsa
      Use ATIS-IDSA scrambling (ATIS-0800006) instead of DVB-CSA2 (the
      default). The control words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  -b value
  --bitrate-ecm value
      Specifies the bitrate for ECM PID's in bits / second. The default is 30,
      000 b/s.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --channel-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_channel_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  --component-level
      Add CA_descriptors at component level in the PMT. By default, the
      CA_descriptor is added at program level.

  -d seconds
  --cp-duration seconds
      Specifies the crypto-period duration in seconds (default: 10).

  --ctr-counter-bits value
      With --aes-ctr, specifies the size in bits of the counter part. In the
      initialization vector, the fixed nounce part uses the first 128-N bits
      and the counter part uses the last N bits. By default, the counter part
      uses the second half of the IV (64 bits).

  -c hexa-data
  --cw hexa-data
      Specifies a fixed and constant control word for all TS packets. The value
      must be a string of 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits with --atis-idsa).

  -f name
  --cw-file name
      Specifies a text file containing the list of control words to apply. Each
      line of the file must contain exactly 16 hexadecimal digits (32 digits
      with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa). The next control word is used each time
      the "scrambling_control" changes in the TS packets header. When all
      control words are used, the first one is used again, and so on.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --dvb-cissa
      Use DVB-CISSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2 (the default). The control
      words are 16-byte long instead of 8-byte.

  --dvb-csa2
      Use DVB-CSA2 scrambling. This is the default.

  -i value
  --ecm-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  -e ip-address:port
  --ecmg ip-address:port
      Specify an ECM Generator host name and port.

  -v value
  --ecmg-scs-version value
      Specifies the version of the ECMG <=> SCS DVB SimulCrypt protocol. Valid
      values are 2 and 3. The default is 2.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-scrambled
      Ignore packets which are already scrambled. Since these packets are
      likely scrambled with a different control word, descrambling will not be
      possible the usual way.

  --iv hexa-data
      With --aes-cbc or --aes-ctr, specifies a fixed initialization vector for
      all TS packets. The value must be a string of 32 hexadecimal digits. The
      default IV is all zeroes.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --log-data[=level]
      Same as --log-protocol but applies to CW_provision and ECM_response
      messages only. To debug the session management without being flooded by
      data messages, use --log-protocol=info --log-data=debug.
      Must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe", "verbose",
      "warning".

  --log-protocol[=level]
      Log all ECMG <=> SCS protocol messages using the specified level. If the
      option is not present, the messages are logged at debug level only. If
      the option is present without value, the messages are logged at info
      level. A level can be a numerical debug level or a name.
      Must be one of "debug", "error", "fatal", "info", "severe", "verbose",
      "warning".

  --no-audio
      Do not scramble audio components in the selected service. By default, all
      audio components are scrambled.

  -n
  --no-entropy-reduction
      With DVB-CSA2, do not perform control word entropy reduction to 48 bits.
      Keep full 64-bit control words. Ignored with --atis-idsa or --dvb-cissa.

  --no-video
      Do not scramble video components in the selected service. By default, all
      video components are scrambled.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --output-cw-file name
      Specifies a text file to create. Each line of the file will contain a
      control word in hexadecimal digits. Each time a new control word is used
      to scramble or descramble packets, it is logged in the file. The created
      file can be used later using --cw-file.

  --partial-scrambling count
      Do not scramble all packets, only one packet every "count" packets. The
      default value is 1, meaning that all packets are scrambled. Specifying
      higher values is a way to reduce the scrambling CPU load while keeping
      the service mostly scrambled.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Scramble packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid options may
      be specified. By default, scramble the specified service.

  --pid-ecm value
      Specifies the new ECM PID for the service. By defaut, use the first
      unused PID immediately following the PMT PID. Using the default, there is
      a risk to later discover that this PID is already used. In that case,
      specify --pid-ecm with a notoriously unused PID value.

  --pre-reduce-cw
      With DVB-CSA2, when entropy reduction is on (the default), make sure that
      control words are reduced from the beginning, including when transmitted
      to an ECMG. By default, entropy reduction is applied just before
      encryption only, and the ECMG receives a full random CW, without entropy
      reduction. The default behavior is suitable to test if the CAS correctly
      handles entropy reduction without implicitly reduced control words.

  --private-data hexa-data
      Specifies the private data to insert in the CA_descriptor in the PMT. The
      value must be a suite of hexadecimal digits.

  --stream-id value
      Specifies the DVB SimulCrypt ECM_stream_id for the ECMG (default: 1).

  --subtitles
      Scramble subtitles components in the selected service. By default, the
      subtitles components are not scrambled.

  -s value
  --super-cas-id value
      Specify the DVB SimulCrypt Super_CAS_Id. This is required when --ecmg is
      specified.

  --synchronous
      Specify to synchronously generate the ECM's. By default, in real-time
      mode, the packet processing continues while generating ECM's. This option
      is always on in offline mode.
