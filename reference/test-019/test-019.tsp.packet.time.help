Schedule packets pass or drop, based on time

Usage: tsp -P time [options]

Options:

  -d value
  --drop value
      All packets are dropped after the specified time. Several --drop options
      may be specified.

      Specifying time values:

      A time value must be in the format "year/month/day:hour:minute:second"
      (unless --relative is specified, in which case it is a number of
      seconds). An empty value ("") means "from the beginning", that is to say
      when tsp starts. By default, packets are passed when tsp starts.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n value
  --null value
      All packets are replaced by null packets after the specified time.
      Several --null options may be specified.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pass value
      All packets are passed unmodified after the specified time. Several
      --pass options may be specified.

  -r
  --relative
      All time values are interpreted as a number of seconds relative to the
      tsp start time. By default, all time values are interpreted as an
      absolute time in the format "year/month/day:hour:minute:second". Option
      --relative is incompatible with --tdt or --utc.

  -s value
  --stop value
      Packet transmission stops after the specified time and tsp terminates.

  -t
  --tdt
      Use the Time & Date Table (TDT) from the transport stream as time
      reference instead of the system clock. Since the TDT contains UTC time,
      all time values in the command line must be UTC also.

  -u
  --utc
      Specifies that all time values in the command line are in UTC. By
      default, the time values are interpreted as system local time.
