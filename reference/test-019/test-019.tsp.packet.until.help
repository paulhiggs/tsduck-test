Copy packets until one of the specified conditions is met

Usage: tsp -P until [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bytes value
      Stop after processing the specified number of bytes.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -e
  --exclude-last
      Exclude the last packet (the one which triggers the final condition).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      When the final condition is triggered, perform a "joint termination"
      instead of unconditional termination. See "tsp --help" for more details
      on "joint termination".

  -m milliseconds
  --milli-seconds milliseconds
      Stop the specified number of milli-seconds after receiving the first
      packet. By default, this is wall-clock time (real time). See also option
      --pcr-based.

  -n value
  --null-sequence-count value
      Stop when the specified number of sequences of consecutive null packets
      is encountered.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --packets value
      Stop after the specified number of packets.

  --pcr-based
      With --seconds or --milli-seconds, use playout time based on PCR values.
      By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real time).

  -s seconds
  --seconds seconds
      Stop the specified number of seconds after receiving the first packet. By
      default, this is wall-clock time (real time). See also option
      --pcr-based.

  -u value
  --unit-start-count value
      Stop when the specified number of packets containing a payload unit start
      indicator is encountered.
