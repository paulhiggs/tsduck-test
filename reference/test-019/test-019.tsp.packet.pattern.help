Replace packet payload with a binary pattern on selected PID's

Usage: tsp -P pattern [options] pattern

Parameter:

  Specifies the binary pattern to apply on TS packets payload. The value must
  be a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes.

Options:

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  -n
  --negate
      Negate the PID filter: modify packets on all PID's, expect the specified
      ones.

  -o value
  --offset-non-pusi value
      Specify starting offset in payload of packets with the PUSI (payload.
      unit start indicator) not set. By default, the pattern replacement starts
      at the beginning of the packet payload (offset 0).

  -u value
  --offset-pusi value
      Specify starting offset in payload of packets with the PUSI (payload.
      unit start indicator) set. By default, the pattern replacement starts at
      the beginning of the packet payload (offset 0).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Select packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid options may be
      specified to select multiple PID's. If no such option is specified,
      packets from all PID's are modified.
