Perform various transformations on the PAT

Usage: tsp -P pat [options]

Options:

  -a service-id/pid
  --add-service service-id/pid
      Add the specified service_id / PMT-PID in the PAT. Several --add-service
      options may be specified to add several services.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the PAT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty PAT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after milliseconds
      Create a new empty PAT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual PAT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --expand-patch-xml
      Expand all environment variables in the patch files before patching. The
      expansion is performed each time a patch file is used. Therefore, if the
      values of the environment variables changed between two usages of the
      patch file, the latest up-to-date environment values are always used.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the PAT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new PAT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the PAT.

  -n value
  --nit value
      Add or modify the NIT PID in the PAT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --patch-xml filename
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all tables on the fly. If
      the name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".
      Several --patch-xml options can be specified. Patch files are
      sequentially applied on each table.

  -u
  --remove-nit
      Remove the NIT PID from the PAT.

  -r id
  --remove-service id
      Remove the specified service_id from the PAT. Several --remove-service
      options may be specified to remove several services.

  -t id
  --ts-id id
      Specify a new value for the transport stream id in the PAT.

  --tsid id
      Same as --ts-id (for compatibility).
