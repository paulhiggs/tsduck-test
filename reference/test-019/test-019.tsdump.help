Dump and format MPEG transport stream packets

Usage: tsdump [options] [filename ...]

Parameters:

  Any number of input MPEG TS files (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --adaptation-field
      Include formatting of the adaptation field.

  -a
  --ascii
      Include ASCII dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  -b
  --binary
      Include binary dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size in bytes (socket option).

  --byte-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified byte offset (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of packet) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --disable-multicast-loop
      Disable multicast loopback. By default, incoming multicast packets are
      looped back on local interfaces, if an application sends packets to the
      same group from the same system. This option disables this.
      Warning: On input sockets, this option is effective only on Windows
      systems. On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, BSD), this option applies only to
      output sockets.

  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  -f name
  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  -h
  --headers-only
      Dump packet headers only, not payload.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ip-udp [[source@]address:]port
      The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive.
      The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
      'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
      listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast
      address. An optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:
      port' in the case of SSM.

  --local-address ip-address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.

  -l
  --log
      Display a short one-line log of each packet instead of full dump.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed in each packet.
      The default is 188 bytes (complete packet).

  -m value
  --max-packets value
      Maximum number of packets to dump per file.

  -n
  --nibble
      Same as --binary but add separator between 4-bit nibbles.

  --no-headers
      Do not display header information.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  -o
  --offset
      Include offset from start of packet with hexadecimal dump.

  --packet-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified TS packet (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  --payload
      Hexadecimal dump of TS payload only, skip TS header.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Dump only packets with these PID values. Several --pid options may be
      specified. By default, all packets are displayed.

  -r
  --raw-file
      Raw dump of file, do not interpret as TS packets.

  --receive-timeout milliseconds
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  --source ip-address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".
