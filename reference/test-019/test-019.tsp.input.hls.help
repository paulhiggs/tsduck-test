Receive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) media

Usage: tsp -I hls [options] url

Parameter:

  Specify the URL of an HLS manifest or playlist. This is typically an URL
  ending in .m3u8. The playlist can be either a master one, referencing several
  versions of the same content (with various bitrates or resolutions). The
  playlist can also be a media playlist, referencing all segments of one single
  content.

Options:

  --alt-group-id 'string'
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the 'alternative rendition
      content' with the specified group id. If several --alt-* options are
      specified, the selected 'alternative rendition content' must match all of
      them.

  --alt-language 'string'
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the first 'alternative rendition
      content' with the specified language. If several --alt-* options are
      specified, the selected 'alternative rendition content' must match all of
      them.

  --alt-name 'string'
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the 'alternative rendition
      content' with the specified name. If several --alt-* options are
      specified, the selected 'alternative rendition content' must match all of
      them.

  --alt-type 'string'
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the first 'alternative rendition
      content' with the specified type. If several --alt-* options are
      specified, the selected 'alternative rendition content' must match all of
      them.

  --compressed
      Accept compressed HTTP responses. By default, compressed responses are
      not accepted.

  --connection-timeout value
      Specify the connection timeout in milliseconds. By default, let the
      operating system decide.

  --headers 'string'
      Custom header, e.g. 'x-header-name: value'. Can be set multiple times.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --highest-bitrate
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the content with the highest
      bitrate.

  --highest-resolution
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the content with the highest
      screen resolution.

  -l
  --list-variants
      When the URL is a master playlist, list all possible streams bitrates and
      resolutions.

  --live
      Specify that the input is a live stream and the playout shall start at

      This is an alias for --start-segment -1.

  --lowest-bitrate
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the content with the lowest
      bitrate.

  --lowest-resolution
      When the URL is a master playlist, use the content with the lowest screen
      resolution.

  --max-bitrate value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the bitrate of which
      is lower than the specified maximum.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --max-height value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the resolution of
      which has a lower height than the specified maximum.

  --max-width value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the resolution of
      which has a lower width than the specified maximum.

  --min-bitrate value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the bitrate of which
      is higher than the specified minimum.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --min-height value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the resolution of

  --min-width value
      When the URL is a master playlist, select a content the resolution of

  --proxy-password string
      Optional proxy password for Internet access (for use with --proxy-user).

  --proxy-port value
      Optional proxy port for Internet access (for use with --proxy-host).

  --proxy-user name
      Optional proxy user name for Internet access.

  --receive-timeout value
      Specify the data reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, let the operating
      system decide.

  --save-files directory-name
      Specify a directory where all downloaded files, media segments and
      playlists, are saved before being passed to the next plugin. This is
      typically a debug option to analyze the input HLS structure.

  -s value
  --segment-count value
      Stop receiving the HLS stream after receiving the specified number of
      media segments. By default, receive the complete content.

  --start-segment value
      Start at the specified segment in the initial playlist. By default, start
      with the first media segment.

      The value can be positive or negative. Positive values are indexes from
      the start of the playlist: 0 is the first segment (the default), +1 is
      the second segment, etc. Negative values are indexes from the end of the
      playlist: -1 is the last segment, -2 is the preceding segment, etc.

  --user-agent 'string'
      Specify the user agent string to send in HTTP requests.
